# Road Accident Analysis in Israel – 2023
## 📌 Overview

This project analyzes a comprehensive dataset of road accidents in Israel during 2023, collected by the Israel Police and the Ministry of Transport. The analysis includes multiple segmentations, providing deep insights into the causes of severe and fatal accidents, and supports data-driven recommendations for targeted interventions to reduce their frequency and impact.

## 🎯 Objectives

Identify the share of severe and fatal accidents out of all reported accidents.

Explore accident patterns by region, time of day, and environmental conditions.

Challenge common assumptions about accident causes using real data.

Propose actionable recommendations to improve road safety.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

Python / Pandas – data manipulation and analysis

Matplotlib / Seaborn – visualizations

Excel – data preparation and validation

Data visualization tools – bar charts, pie charts, and heatmaps for insights presentation

## 📊 Key Findings

### Severity Distribution

8,832 total reported accidents in 2023

Fatal: 338 (3.8%)

Severe: 2,374 (26.9%)

Light: 6,120 (69.3%)
→ ~30.7% of all accidents were severe or fatal – the main focus for reducing road deaths.

### Geographic Hotspots

~50% of severe/fatal accidents occurred in three police districts: Galilee, Tel Aviv, and Sharon.

Expanding to six districts covers ~78% of all severe/fatal accidents.

Recommendation: prioritize enforcement, infrastructure upgrades, and lighting improvements in these high-risk zones.

### Weather & Road Conditions

~79% of severe/fatal accidents occurred in clear weather.

~93.4% occurred on fully maintained roads.

Insight: accidents are primarily driven by human factors (inattention, speeding), not poor infrastructure or bad weather.

### Time of Day Analysis

Peak risk: 12:00–19:00 (44% of severe/fatal accidents).

Lowest risk: 00:00–07:00 (~10% of accidents).

Recommendation: intensify police presence and monitoring during high-risk hours.
